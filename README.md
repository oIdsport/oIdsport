stuff for ponytown

(1)　idm crowns, kisses or things like that. though im mostly afk so whispers are better for me　(2)　i replace words like two/too with numbers　(3)　i am not usually online, but if i am i tend to sit in the fnaf area/docks　(4)　i do not have a dni list, i block freely and without warnings　(5)　if im not comfy talking to you i probably won't talk or reply to whispers, that or i'm prob afk 

though if you wanna say something nice about my skins on pt i just rather you put it in my guestbook ^_^

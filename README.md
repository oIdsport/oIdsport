stuff for ponytown

(1)　idm crowns, kisses or things like that. though im mostly afk so whispers are better for me　(2)　i replace words like two/too with numbers　(3)　i am not usually online, but if i am i tend to sit in the fnaf area/gi area/docks　(4)　i do not have a dni list, i block freely and without warnings　(5)　if im not comfy talking to you i probably won't talk or reply to whispers, that or i'm prob afk, it's usually cuz im afk! so nws　(6)　i struggle typing most of the times, please do not correct my typos. some are intentional


my current hyperfixations are jujutsu kaisen, fortnite, splatoon, fnaf/dsaf and trolls! if we share any don't be afraid to interact.　i might seem a little dry, i apologize in advance idk how to talk to people
